# Clock Project

## Overview
This project is a simple analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a visually appealing design with smooth second-hand transitions.

## Features
- Real-time clock updates every second
- Smooth second-hand movement
- Responsive design with a gradient background
- Shadow effects for a realistic look

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the clock
- **CSS**: Styling and positioning of clock elements
- **JavaScript**: Logic to update the clock hands based on real-time

## File Structure
```
ðŸ“‚ Clock Project
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # Main HTML structure
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css       # Styling for the clock
â””â”€â”€ app.js          # JavaScript logic to update time
```

## How It Works
1. **HTML Structure**: The clock consists of a circular container with numbers, minute marks, and three clock hands (hour, minute, second).
2. **CSS Styling**: Styles define the layout, positioning, and shadows to create a realistic clock face.
3. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - Retrieves the current time using `Date` object.
   - Calculates rotation angles for each hand.
   - Updates the hand positions every second.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. The clock will start running automatically.

## Future Enhancements
- Add ticking sound effects
- Implement a digital clock alongside the analog clock
- Support for different clock themes
